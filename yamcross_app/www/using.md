# Data collection

<b>Notes:</b>

  - Before starting any data collection, you must update the app by
    going to home page and clicking on <b>“Get Blank Form”</b> and
    selecting the specific form you are using. This is better done one
    every morning before going to the field or to collect data.

  - Once you are done for the day, the data collected must be syched to
    the central server, ensure that your tablet is connected to
    wifi/celluar in order to submit the collected data. It is always
    advisable to ensure that the data has been submitted and no error is
    encountered during this process.

### 5\. Seed processing

1.  Scan the CrossID

2.  Select date of seed processing

3.  Count the total number of

#### <b> At this point, a new-id, FamilyID is generated in yambase which should be used to proceed in the next steps</b>

### 6\. Sowing

1.  Scan the FamilyID

2.  Select date of sowing

3.  Enter the number of seeds sowed

### 7\. Germination

Germination can be recorded multiple times whenever seedlings have
germinated

1.  Scan the FamilyID

2.  Select date of seedling germination

3.  Count the number of seedling germinating

### 8\. Transplanting
